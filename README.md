## STO Themes for PWE 2015 Vanilla Forums ##

These are built upon the general edits made by [NRGLG] (https://github.com/Goodlookinguy/pwvnrg) so you don't need to run anything other than one of these.<br><br>

#Installation#
The simplest and preferred installation is to use [Asterpw](https://github.com/asterpw/pwevanillaenhance)'s PWE Vanilla Forums Enhancement JavaScript.<br>
Doing this will mean you'll always get the latest versions of the themes, including bug fixes, without any effort on your part.<br><br>

Alternatively, you can use the Stylish plugin for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/stylish/).<br>
Just add the code from the theme you wish to use and be sure to set it to work on URLs starting with "http://perfectworld.vanillaforums.com/" AND "http://www.arcgames.com".<br><br>

#Credits#
[NRGLG](https://github.com/Goodlookinguy/pwvnrg) for his excellent CSS edits for the forums, without which I probably wouldn't have bothered making these.<br>
[Asterpw](https://github.com/asterpw/pwevanillaenhance) for his JavaScript handler which helps make modifying the forums a lot easier and more central instead of using multiple files and plugins.<br>
Eiledon (don't know if he has a GitHub) for his menu integration for each game's sub forum.<br>
